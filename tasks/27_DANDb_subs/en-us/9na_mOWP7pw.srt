00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,851
So the answer is a bigger sample. If we chose this one also, and let's say these
所以答案是更大的样本 如果我们也选择这个 那么我们可以说
2
00:00:05,863 --> 00:00:11,425
two, so we double our sample size. Then you see we have this small value 32%.
这两个 所以我们把样本量扩大到两倍 然后你看到我们有这个小的值 32%
3
00:00:11,546 --> 00:00:17,142
And that's going to drag down the sample statistic X bar, the average. So, this
那样会把样本的平均值降低 所以
4
00:00:17,154 --> 00:00:22,600
will be closer to the population average mu. And of course, ideally, we'd want
这样做会更接近总体的均值 当然 理想上 我们想知道
5
00:00:22,612 --> 00:00:27,455
the entire population, but often times that's really hard to do, because the
总体的情况 但通常那样做会很困难 因为
6
00:00:27,467 --> 00:00:32,290
population might be so big. That's when we need a sample. But a bigger sample
总体数量很可能非常大 所以我们需要一个样本 不过更大的样本
7
00:00:32,302 --> 00:00:37,465
will better approximate the population parameter. Another example where samples
能够更好的估计总体参数 另外一个样本
8
00:00:37,477 --> 00:00:42,424
can be misleading is predicting the outcome of the presidential election. For
会产生误差的例子是预测总统选举结果 
9
00:00:42,436 --> 00:00:46,970
this last Presidential election with President Obama versus Mitt Romney, a lot
在上次 Obama 对 Mitt Romney 的总统选举中 很多
10
00:00:46,982 --> 00:00:51,238
of polls were given out which each came up with its own result. Some of them
民意测验都会给出它们自己的预测结果 其中一些
11
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:55,670
predicted that Romney was going to win, which as we know didn't happen. While
认为 Romney 会赢 然而我们知道结果不是这样的 因为
12
00:00:55,682 --> 00:01:00,209
each sample may not perfectly predict population parameters. The sample
每一个样本可能没法完美的预测总体参数 样本
13
00:01:00,221 --> 00:01:05,743
statistic can give us an interval in which the population parameter lies, as
统计量能给我们一个包含总体参数的区间，
14
00:01:05,755 --> 00:01:11,165
long as the sample is random and as unbiased as possible. We'll go more into
只要样本的选取是尽可能随机地、无偏地 之后我们会对样本做
15
00:01:11,177 --> 00:01:13,047
