00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,445
The earliest known academic rating about the meaning of random was by John Venn
已知最早的是 John Venn 于 1888 年在他的著作 The Logic of Chance 
2
00:00:04,457 --> 00:00:08,650
in 1888 and his book called the logic of chance. He said, Perhaps the best
对随机这一概念进行学术定义 他认为

00:00:08,662 --> 00:00:12,541
typical example that we can give of the scientific meaning of random
也许关于随机分布的科学定义的
4
00:00:12,553 --> 00:00:17,099
distribution is afforded by the arrangement of the drops of rain in a shower. No
最典型的例子是一场雨中雨滴落下的位置分布 没有
5
00:00:17,111 --> 00:00:21,430
one can give a guess whereabouts at any instant a drop will fall, but we know
人能够预测在任何瞬间一滴雨会落在哪里 但是我们知道
6
00:00:21,442 --> 00:00:25,837
that if we put out a sheet of paper it will gradually become uniformly spotted
如果我们放一张纸 这张纸就会渐渐均匀的淋上雨滴
7
00:00:25,849 --> 00:00:30,473
over. And if we were to mark out any two equal areas on the paper, these would
并且如果我们在纸上任意全出两块区域 通常这两块区域会
8
00:00:30,485 --> 00:00:34,880
gradually tend to be struck equally often. Therefore, when we have a random
渐渐平均的淋上雨 因此 当我们有一个随机
9
00:00:34,892 --> 00:00:39,504
sample, each subject has an equal chance of being selected. And then our sample
样本 其中每一个对象都有均等的机会被挑选到时 我们的样本
10
00:00:39,516 --> 00:00:42,111
is more likely to approximate the population.
更有可能估计总体
