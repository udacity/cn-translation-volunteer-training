1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,860
So, here I am, back at the code, and

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:05,620
here I can see my class movie, and within it

3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:08,990
I will begin to define, [SOUND] the function, init.

4
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:12,290
Now, there is something very curious about this function already,

5
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:14,750
which is that, there are two underscores on both

6
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:17,740
sides of the word in it. These underscores are a

7
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:21,750
way for Python to tell us, the programmers, that hey,

8
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,520
the name init, is essentially reserved in Python, and that,

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,210
this is a special function or method. What's

10
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:31,690
special about init? Is that, it initializes or creates

11
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:35,460
space in memory. To remember details like title, story

12
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,630
line, et cetera, for new movies that we are

13
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:40,530
about to create. Now init, takes a few

14
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:43,990
pieces of information or arguments. The first of which,

15
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:47,780
is always the python keyword, self. Now, what is

16
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:50,620
this thing called, self, you ask? Well, you can

17
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:54,600
think of self as itself, or the instance being created.

18
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,230
So, when we run this line of code in our

19
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:00,110
other Python file, by the way, just to remind you,

20
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:02,900
here we are trying to create a new movie called, toy_story.

21
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,590
And when we run this line of code, we know

22
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:08,400
that the __init__ function inside the class Movie gets called. Self,

23
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,410
in that case, points to toy_story. Now here, I have

24
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:15,830
a confession to make. I remember when I was first learning

25
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:19,360
object oriented programming years ago in college. This concept of

26
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,980
self, was really difficult for me to understand. If that

27
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:25,090
is the case with you, don't worry about it too

28
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:28,060
much for now. This will get, really clear when we

29
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:30,990
learn this entire piece of coding a few seconds. In

30
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,260
any case, let's add the keyword self, to our list

31
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,880
of new words. Okay, I'm going to go back to

32
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,830
the class movie, and continue to define the function, init.

33
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:46,070
Now, we want init, to initialize pieces of information like title, story line

34
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:51,027
and others that we want to remember inside our class. Here's a way to do that. I

35
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:55,674
will say, self.title, then self.storyline.

36
00:01:55,674 --> 00:02:00,504
[SOUND] The next one is, poster_image_url, and

37
00:02:00,504 --> 00:02:05,940
finally, trailer_youtube_url. Now, we have to somehow initialize

38
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:08,979
these variables, with information init is going to

39
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:11,760
receive. And in particular, it's going to receive, four

40
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,590
pieces of information. The first of which is,

41
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:18,360
a movie title, [SOUND] next is, the movie storyline,

42
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,060
then the poster image of the movie, and

43
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:24,970
finally, the trailer on YouTube. So,get this, once I've

44
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:27,820
received these four pieces of information as arguments to

45
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:31,550
the __init__ function, I can initialize my Movie variables.

46
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:34,330
Here's how to do that. self.title, is the movie

47
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:38,612
title. Self.storyline, is the movie story line. Next is,

48
00:02:38,612 --> 00:02:41,994
[SOUND] the poster image. And finally, [SOUND] the trailer

49
00:02:41,994 --> 00:02:44,910
on youtube. Now here, I have a confession to

50
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:47,580
make. Which is, that we've written a lot of

51
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,210
code that looks new and strange. Well, the one

52
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:52,570
thing I can say is that, we should all

53
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:55,020
just take a pause and a deep breath together.

54
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:59,448
[SOUND]. For now, all I want you to do, is

55
00:02:59,448 --> 00:03:02,010
pause this video, and write down this code on your

56
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:05,400
computer. All of this code will make sense as soon

57
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,840
as we run this program. Now, there is one key point

58
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,470
I would like to highlight, before I execute this piece

59
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:14,090
of code, which is, that if I go to my

60
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:18,400
other Python file, which is entertainment_center.py. And run this piece

61
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,320
of code. It will throw an error. The error will happen,

62
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,030
because when we try to create the movie, Toy

63
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:28,180
Story, the init function gets called, which is now

64
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:31,730
looking for several arguments or pieces of information, although,

65
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:35,210
we are not sending it any information whatsoever. So

66
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:37,940
let me change that. Now, I know that first

67
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:41,080
argument for the edit function is, self. Which is

68
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,410
added by default in Python. So I will skip

69
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:47,450
it. The next one is movie title, which I know

70
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:52,530
is, Toy Story, so I will add that. After that, is the movie

71
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:57,540
storyline, so I will type that in next. A Story. Of

72
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:02,350
a boy and his toys that come to

73
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:07,700
life. The next one is, the power image, so I will add that.

74
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:12,970
[SOUND] I had previously gone on Wikipedia and found a link to, Toy Story's

75
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:18,970
poster, so I added that and finally, the Youtube trailer, which I will add also.

76
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:23,450
[SOUND] There it is. Now, let me just scroll

77
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:24,990
back so we can see the beginning of the

78
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:28,240
code. Here, I recognize that you can't see all

79
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,690
of the code, so what I've done is, take an

80
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:32,910
image of the code, and put it in the

81
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:35,760
instructor notes for you to look at. All right,

82
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,870
the last thing I'm going to do here, is

83
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:42,490
type Toy Story's story line. Let me save this file,

84
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:50,740
and then go back to my class Movie file, and save that one also. And then

85
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:55,850
come back again, to my entertainment_center.py file. Now

86
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:58,430
here, if everything goes correctly, my program should

87
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:03,220
print out, toy_story.storyline. Let's run it. And there

88
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,300
it is, Toy story, storyline is getting printed.

89
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,600
Okay, so, in the next video we are

90
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,970
going to see what happens behind the scenes when

91
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:11,020
we run this piece of code.
