1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:05,419
JavaScript is created in just 10
days by Brendan Eich back in 1995,

2
00:00:05,419 --> 00:00:08,028
while Eich was working
on Netscape Navigator.

3
00:00:08,028 --> 00:00:09,529
For those of you don't know,

4
00:00:09,529 --> 00:00:13,239
Netscape Navigator was one of
the Internet's first web browsers.

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,750
Today, you use browsers
like Google Chrome,

6
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:20,478
Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, and
Microsoft Edge to surf the web.

7
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:23,910
>> Prior to Eich's creation of
JavaScript, websites just existed as

8
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:28,910
pages of HTML and CSS with
the occasional plug-in or Java applet.

9
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:29,969
>> Wait, Java?

10
00:00:29,969 --> 00:00:32,129
>> Yes, well, at least at first.

11
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:35,440
JavaScript, what this course is about,
is totally different and

12
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:38,140
not related to Java in any way.

13
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:43,009
The fact is, JavaScript has had sort
of a weird past when it comes to names.

14
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:45,539
JavaScript was originally
called LiveScript but

15
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:48,390
it was changed back to JavaScript
as a marketing decision in

16
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,020
order to piggyback off
the popularity of Java at the time.

17
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,550
As the language evolved, competing
versions of the language emerged.

18
00:00:55,549 --> 00:00:58,339
So JavaScript was eventually
taken to Ecma International so

19
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:01,160
that an official standard for
the language could be formed.

20
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:04,348
>> Today, the language itself is
still referred to as JavaScript.

21
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:07,680
But recent versions are referenced
by their ECMAScript version number,

22
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,720
like ES5 or ES6.

23
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:13,760
Even more recently, the standards body
has transitioned to a year-based number

24
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,130
to promote a more
consistent release cycle.

25
00:01:16,129 --> 00:01:19,539
So we have now have ES2016,
ES2017, and so on.

26
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,560
I know, it's confusing.

27
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,490
>> All things considered, JavaScript
has grown to be one of the most popular

28
00:01:25,489 --> 00:01:29,359
languages in the world and is considered
one of the three foundational pillars of

29
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:30,531
front end web development.
