00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,429
in this video i am going to show you how
to get to Google Chrome's developers

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:05,312
tool to access JavaScript console.

3
00:00:05,312 --> 00:00:08,560
You're going to be using the console to
run most of the code that you write in

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:09,839
this course.

5
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:12,710
if you are already using Google Chrome
then what you see in this video should

6
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:14,640
match up in what you
see on your computer.

7
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,350
But if you're not using Google Chrome,
then skip ahead to the next section for

8
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:21,720
instructions on how to access
developer tools in other browsers, and

9
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:22,809
then come back to this video.

10
00:00:22,809 --> 00:00:23,779
All right,

11
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:27,370
now the first thing you'll need to
do is to open up developer tools.

12
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:31,617
You can do this by right clicking
on the page, and selecting Inspect.

13
00:00:31,617 --> 00:00:33,600
Once you have developer tools open,

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,249
you can find the JavaScript Console
by clicking on the Console tab.

15
00:00:37,249 --> 00:00:42,097
If you like keyboard shortcuts,
you can also use Cmd+Option+J on a Mac

16
00:00:42,097 --> 00:00:46,410
to open the console, or
you can use Ctrl+Shift+J on Windows.

17
00:00:46,409 --> 00:00:49,401
There's a really useful reference
of keyboard shortcuts for

18
00:00:49,402 --> 00:00:51,481
developer tools linked below this video.

19
00:00:51,481 --> 00:00:54,042
All right, so now that you have
the JavaScript console open,

20
00:00:54,042 --> 00:00:57,079
let's write your first
line of JavaScript code.

21
00:00:57,079 --> 00:00:59,289
One thing you could do
is write your name.

22
00:00:59,289 --> 00:01:04,109
But just writing your name will actually
result in an error as you can see here.

23
00:01:04,109 --> 00:01:07,620
To be able to actually write your
name in JavaScript without any error

24
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:10,620
you need to format your name
as a data type called a string

25
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:11,750
by putting it inside quotes.

26
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,150
Why don't we try something else?

27
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:18,030
Here's some code that creates
an alert window that says, Hello,

28
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:19,710
Julia, how are you?

29
00:01:19,709 --> 00:01:21,609
And it pushes it to the browser.

30
00:01:21,609 --> 00:01:22,079
There you go.

31
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:25,859
Now writing code directly in your
browser is something you can do to test

32
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:30,218
out new code snippets where you're
not really sure what they do.

33
00:01:30,218 --> 00:01:32,700
But it could actually get pretty
annoying once you starting writing

34
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,939
larger and larger programs.

35
00:01:34,939 --> 00:01:38,649
For example, if you wanted to create
two alerts instead of just one,

36
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:43,190
it may seem simple at first, but each
time you need to go to the next line,

37
00:01:43,189 --> 00:01:47,259
you would have to type Shift+Return
instead of just the Return key.

38
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:50,730
This is going to get pretty
annoying pretty fast.

39
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:51,829
Eventually in the next course,

40
00:01:51,829 --> 00:01:54,280
you'll learn about other ways
to run JavaScript files.

41
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,530
But for now we recommend using a text
editor like Atom or Sublime Text and

42
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:01,200
then pasting your code in the console
once you're ready to test it.
