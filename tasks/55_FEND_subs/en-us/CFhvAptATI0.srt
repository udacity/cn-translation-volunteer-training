1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,450
Developer tools allow you to debug and

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:05,310
test out your ideas
directly in the browser.

3
00:00:05,309 --> 00:00:08,118
If you're familiar with HTML or CSS,

4
00:00:08,118 --> 00:00:11,750
you may have used developer tools to
experiment with the style of a webpage.

5
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:14,109
But you can also use it with JavaScript.

6
00:00:14,109 --> 00:00:17,030
>> Developer tools are often
used as a sandbox.

7
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:17,810
In other words,

8
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:22,570
a place to mess around with any code
without any long-term consequences.

9
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:25,609
You can use developer tools to
debug problem you run in to or

10
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:28,030
to test a piece of code
you've just learned.

11
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:30,539
If you open any website
that uses JavaScript,

12
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:34,129
the console will tell you if there any
warnings or errors on the page and

13
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:37,625
will also display any output,
print it with console.log.

14
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:40,875
>> Note that anytime you're using
the console on these course,

15
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:44,405
you might see some errors or
warnings from the site you're visiting.

16
00:00:44,405 --> 00:00:46,835
That's okay, this is very common and

17
00:00:46,835 --> 00:00:49,045
will not affect the code that
you write in these course.
