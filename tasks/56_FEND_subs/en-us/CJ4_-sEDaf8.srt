00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,140
A programming language is used for
a computer to understand.

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:06,769
But as your code gets more and more
complex, it can get harder and harder

3
00:00:06,769 --> 00:00:10,800
for you and other humans to read your
code and to understand what it does.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,530
Comments are often used by developers to
help clarify the meaning of your code

5
00:00:14,529 --> 00:00:16,289
in a human-friendly language.

6
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:20,439
In JavaScript, a comment is any
text after a double forward slash

7
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:23,580
if you want to write comments
one line at a time like this, or

8
00:00:23,579 --> 00:00:25,949
any text in between a slash star and

9
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:30,039
star slash if you know you're going
to be writing a block of comments.

10
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:32,990
Comments are not executed by
the JavaScript interpreter, so

11
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:35,820
you could pretty much say
anything you want in the comment.

12
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,869
But usually you try to make them
a little more useful than this.

13
00:00:38,869 --> 00:00:41,780
For example, here's some code
I wrote a while ago, and

14
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:44,870
it's not really obvious to me
what I was doing with this code.

15
00:00:44,869 --> 00:00:47,549
There's seems to be a function,
a for loop,

16
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:50,759
some variables with really
bad variable names.

17
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:53,599
Don't worry if you don't know
what any of these means just yet.

18
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,020
What you need to know right now is
that if I had used comments like this,

19
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,175
I would, and you probably would too,

20
00:01:00,174 --> 00:01:04,319
have an easier time remembering
what this code was originally for.

21
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,780
See, now I can tell that this function
reverses the order of characters in

22
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:12,599
a word, and it does this by looping
over the characters in reverse order and

23
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:14,379
adding them to a new word.

24
00:01:14,379 --> 00:01:18,500
Some of the quizzes in this course might
include comments that give you hints or

25
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,269
instructions to complete a quiz.

26
00:01:20,269 --> 00:01:22,829
We encourage you to use
comments in your own code

27
00:01:22,829 --> 00:01:26,390
to explain any non-obvious code
you write in your quizzes.

28
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:28,930
Not only will you develop
good coding habits, but

29
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:31,700
you will also improve
the readability of your code

30
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,269
if you ever need to refer back
to these quizzes for review.

31
00:01:34,269 --> 00:01:38,030
All right, now it's time to
go on to your first quiz.

32
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:38,409
Good luck.
