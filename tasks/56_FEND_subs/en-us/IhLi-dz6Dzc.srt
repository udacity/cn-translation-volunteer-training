00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,940
Let's take a look at
the string datatype.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:06,509
You've actually used a string before,
and maybe just didn't know it.

3
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:09,150
When you type a message
inside console.log,

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,509
that message is actually
just a JavaScript string.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,839
So here, Hiya, Friend, is just a string.

6
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:20,760
Strings can be single letters,
like the character h, or

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,450
even contain numbers,
like the string 123.

8
00:00:25,449 --> 00:00:28,879
The important thing is that you
use quotes to signify a string.

9
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:30,869
It doesn't matter if
the quotes are single or

10
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:34,146
double quotes, but
they do have to match.

11
00:00:34,146 --> 00:00:37,929
I used double quotes here and
single quotes here.

12
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,800
If I try to pass the string
to console.log but

13
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:46,429
forget to use the quotes,
JavaScript will return back an error.

14
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:51,399
I get this reference error, because
the JavaScript engine thinks I'm talking

15
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:55,829
about a variable called hello instead
of a string with the value of hello.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,271
We haven't talked about variables just
yet, but the moral of the story here

17
00:01:01,271 --> 00:01:04,021
is to remember to use
quotes when using strings.

18
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:05,435

19
00:01:05,435 --> 00:01:09,353
If I add the quotes in, then the string
gets printed out to the console.
