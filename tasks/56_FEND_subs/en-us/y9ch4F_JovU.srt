1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:02,020
Data is everywhere.

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:04,099
It's the grade you made
on your first math test,

3
00:00:04,099 --> 00:00:06,139
it's the conversation you
have with a loved one and

4
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:08,609
it's the decision you made to
sit down and watch this video.

5
00:00:09,859 --> 00:00:11,910
All of these things can
be represented as data.

6
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:16,730
Data's important because it helps us
understand the world, recognize trends,

7
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:19,960
make educated guesses and
inform our future decisions.

8
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,060
>> This is no different in programming.

9
00:00:22,059 --> 00:00:25,780
Data and data types are the building
blocks of any programming language

10
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:28,199
because they help us
organize information and

11
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:30,195
determine how our programs will run.

12
00:00:30,195 --> 00:00:33,256
>> When you look on your Facebook
profile, what do you see?

13
00:00:33,256 --> 00:00:36,856
Your name, the number of friends you
have, the date of your last post,

14
00:00:36,856 --> 00:00:41,810
list of status updates and whether you
liked the comment your friend just made.

15
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:44,590
All this information is being gathered,
calculated and

16
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:47,860
presented to your friends and
family visiting your profile.

17
00:00:47,859 --> 00:00:50,729
>> And when you look at your
bank account, what do you see?

18
00:00:50,729 --> 00:00:54,899
An account number, an account balance,
dates of each transaction and

19
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:57,729
the name of the company that
you made a purchase from.

20
00:00:57,729 --> 00:01:01,149
It's important to be aware of what
types of data you're using and

21
00:01:01,149 --> 00:01:02,519
when it's appropriate to use each type.

22
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:06,409
>> In this lesson, we'll start
by learning how to define and

23
00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:09,390
manipulate the primitive
data types of JavaScript.

24
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:14,010
Numbers, strings, Booleans,
undefined and null.

25
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,160
Once you're familiar with these data
types, you'll see how you can store data

26
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:20,840
into variables so you can reuse and
manipulate data throughout your code.
