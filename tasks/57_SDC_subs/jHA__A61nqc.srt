1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,540
My name is Sebastian.

2
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:03,390
I welcome you to our
self driving car nanodegree

3
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:06,390
The self driving car
started when I was 18.

4
00:00:06,389 --> 00:00:11,550
One of my best friends in the
neighborhood died in a traffic accident.

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,150
His life went away in no time.

6
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:17,769
And back in the day, I asked myself,
why is it that we have these machines

7
00:00:17,769 --> 00:00:22,109
that are great on one hand,
but still kill so many people?

8
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:24,829
It stuck with me for a long time.

9
00:00:24,829 --> 00:00:28,299
And when I joined Stanford in 2003,
the US government

10
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:33,160
had just launched a competition
called the DARPA Grand Challenge.

11
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:38,089
It's a competition where a self driven
car had to drive through an empty desert

12
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:39,620
in California.

13
00:00:39,619 --> 00:00:40,719
Our car Stanley,

14
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:46,320
named after Stanford was a blue,
beautiful Volkswagen Touareg.

15
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,920
And lo and
behold we won the competition.

16
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,490
My team joined Google in 2009 to build

17
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:57,990
a self driving car that could drive
on public streets where we all drive.

18
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:00,450
And when we were ready to
tell the public about it,

19
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:05,236
we had driven not just 100,000 unique
miles for the self driving cars.

20
00:01:05,236 --> 00:01:09,070
But we've also driven pretty much
the hardest streets in California you

21
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,769
can imagine, completely self driven.

22
00:01:11,769 --> 00:01:14,259
We drove from San Francisco
to Los Angeles.

23
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:17,130
The technology has been in
development for many, many decades,

24
00:01:17,129 --> 00:01:20,115
but the breakthroughs
are often most recent years.

25
00:01:20,115 --> 00:01:24,019
More than self driven cars
now we have proven others can

26
00:01:24,019 --> 00:01:27,649
drive safer than humans can drive and
automotive companies and

27
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:30,846
tech companies are struggling to
find great engineers to keep up.

28
00:01:30,846 --> 00:01:34,972
This is the self driven program and
when you are finished,

29
00:01:34,972 --> 00:01:39,709
you will have the skills to drawing
this cutting edge industry.

30
00:01:39,709 --> 00:01:42,640
We are super excited
to have you with us.
