00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,150
You've now seen how you can
perform basic operations,

2
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:06,390
as well as comparisons on numbers and
strings.

3
00:00:06,389 --> 00:00:07,849
>> Whenever you compare data,

4
00:00:07,849 --> 00:00:11,640
the result of the comparison will
always be a value of true or false.

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,650
This is important because our
third primitive data type,

6
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:17,780
Booleans, only includes
these two values.

7
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:23,410
>> Just think, yes or no, on and
off, true or false, ones and zeroes.

8
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:25,740
These are all values that really
represent the same thing.

9
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:31,099
>> And this Boolean logic is a huge
part of how we think about problems.

10
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,000
Code either runs or

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,789
it doesn't, there's no in-between,
at least not in programming.

12
00:00:35,789 --> 00:00:39,359
>> In this section, you'll dive deeper
into Booleans by comparing data of

13
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:42,549
different types and learning about
different ways to express equality.
