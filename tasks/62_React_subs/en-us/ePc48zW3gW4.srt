00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,060
Welcome to the program,

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:06,535
I'm Richard the curriculum lead for Front-end Web Development at Udacity.

3
00:00:06,535 --> 00:00:08,480
You're now an essential member of

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,259
the Udacity community and we are so excited to have you here.

5
00:00:12,259 --> 00:00:15,550
I'm looking forward to helping guide your journey through React.

6
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:20,425
And in this program you'll be building applications along with Michael, Ryan and Tyler.

7
00:00:20,425 --> 00:00:24,725
These projects are ones that you'll be building in class while learning React.

8
00:00:24,725 --> 00:00:29,405
Here at your Udacity we can't stress enough the importance of learning by doing.

9
00:00:29,405 --> 00:00:31,515
So in addition to the in-class projects,

10
00:00:31,515 --> 00:00:35,375
you'll also be given some projects that you'll build on your own.

11
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:39,298
These projects will prove how much you've learned. It'll be great.

12
00:00:39,298 --> 00:00:43,189
For the first project you'll build an application called My Reads.

13
00:00:43,189 --> 00:00:45,215
This app will require you to manage state,

14
00:00:45,215 --> 00:00:48,604
build components and leverage React Router.

15
00:00:48,603 --> 00:00:52,283
This project is all about mastering the fundamentals of React.

16
00:00:52,283 --> 00:00:54,649
Now by fundamentals I mean the stuff you'll be doing

17
00:00:54,649 --> 00:00:58,115
in every single React project you create.

18
00:00:58,115 --> 00:01:02,000
Check out the following sections for a more in-depth look at what you'll be building.
