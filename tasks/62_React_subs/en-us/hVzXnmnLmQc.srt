00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,805
You're probably familiar with the idea of functions.

2
00:00:02,805 --> 00:00:08,060
When to use a function and when not to use one probably comes pretty naturally to you.

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,198
One of the best parts about React is that

4
00:00:10,198 --> 00:00:12,765
you can use the same intuition you have about functions,

5
00:00:12,765 --> 00:00:15,150
for when you create React components.

6
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,914
However, instead of your function taking in some arguments or returning a value,

7
00:00:18,914 --> 00:00:21,149
your function is going to take in some arguments and

8
00:00:21,149 --> 00:00:24,504
return some UI. Let's take a look at some code.

9
00:00:24,504 --> 00:00:29,660
Here, we have three functions and one function invocation.

10
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,925
You'll notice our code is clean and organized because

11
00:00:31,925 --> 00:00:34,783
each function has a specific purpose.

12
00:00:34,783 --> 00:00:38,689
We're composing our functions together by having one function get profiled

13
00:00:38,689 --> 00:00:44,695
data whereas the other two functions getProfilePic and getProfileLink.

14
00:00:44,695 --> 00:00:47,465
Now, when we invoke getProfileData,

15
00:00:47,465 --> 00:00:51,094
we get an object back which represents our user.

16
00:00:51,094 --> 00:00:54,270
Now instead of having these functions return an object with data,

17
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:57,880
let's modify them just a bit to return some UI.

18
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,990
Now don't freak out about the syntax.

19
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:03,484
We're going to cover this code much more in depth in future lessons.

20
00:01:03,484 --> 00:01:07,790
But for now, notice that instead of composing functions to get some value,

21
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:10,010
we're composing functions to get some UI.
